GPU Programming: When, Why and How?
===================================

Graphical processing units (GPUs) are the workhorse of many high performance 
computing (HPC) systems around the world. The number of GPU-enabled supercomputers 
on the `Top500 <https://www.top500.org/>`__ has been steadily increasing in recent years 
and this development is expected to continue. In the near future, the majority of HPC 
computing power available to researchers and engineers is likely to be provided by GPUs 
or other types of accelerators. Programming GPUs and other accelerators is thus crucial
to developers of software run on HPC systems.

However, the landscape of GPU hardware, software and programming environments is complicated. 
Multiple vendors compete in the high-end GPU market, with each vendor providing its own software 
stack and development toolkits, and even beyond that, there is a proliferation of tools, 
languages and frameworks that can be used to write code for GPUs.
It can thus be difficult for individual developers and project owners to know how to 
navigate across this landscape and select the most appropriate GPU programming framework for their 
projects based on the requirements of a given project and technical requirements of any 
existing code.

This material is meant to help both software developers and decision makers navigate the 
GPU programming landscape and make more informed decisions on which languages or frameworks 
to learn and use for their projects. Specifically, you will:

- Understand why and when to use GPUs.
- Become comfortable with key concepts in GPU programming.
- Acquire a comprehensive overview of different software frameworks, what levels they operate at, and which to use when.
- Learn the fundamentals in at least one framework to a level which will enable you to quickly become a productive GPU programmer.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This material is most relevant to researchers and engineers who already develop software 
which runs on CPUs in workstations or supercomputers, but also to decision makers or 
project managers who don't write code but make strategic decisions in software projects, 
whether it's in academia, industry or the public sector.
